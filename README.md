# Games

This repository is a  playground for getting better with React, Redux, Clojure, and Genetic Programming

The goal is for each directory at this top level to contain frontend React code that shows a game board, and backend code that controls the logic for playing each game. Somewhere, maybe in the directory called `brain`, there will exist code which will use Genetic Programming to evolve players for each game.
